# Project Steps Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the steps for implementing the Excel to JSON conversion POC (Proof of Concept).

## Current Status
- ✅ Analyzed client's Excel data structure
- ✅ Documented JSON schema requirements
- ✅ Created component type mapping documentation
- ✅ Validated mapping against sample data
- ✅ Created test cases for each component type

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Analysis and Mapping (Completed)
- [x] Analyze Excel data structure
- [x] Document JSON schema requirements
- [x] Create component type mapping
- [x] Validate mapping against sample data
- [x] Create test cases for each component type

### 2. Development Setup (Completed)
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Set up version control
- [x] Create development branch

### 3. Core Implementation (Completed)
- [x] Create Excel parser
  - [x] Implement Excel file reading
  - [x] Handle different Excel formats
  - [x] Extract component data
- [x] Create JSON generator
  - [x] Implement component mapping logic
  - [x] Generate UUIDs
  - [x] Apply validation rules
  - [x] Handle special cases

### 4. Component Implementation (In Progress)
- [x] Implement Selection Components
  - [x] select_single_cards
  - [x] select_card
  - [x] select_single_dropdown
  - [x] select_option
- [x] Implement Text Input Components
  - [x] input_text_line
  - [x] input_text_area
  - [x] input_email
- [x] Implement Numeric Input Components
  - [x] input_number
  - [x] input_currency
  - [x] input_percentage
- [x] Implement Date and Time Components
  - [x] pick_date_time
- [x] Implement File Components
  - [x] pick_file
- [x] Implement Overlay Components
  - [x] input_overlay

### 5. Testing (In Progress)
- [x] Create test suite
  - [x] Unit tests for each component
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end tests
- [x] Test with sample data
- [ ] Validate output against schema
- [ ] Performance testing

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Deployment instructions

### 7. Deployment
- [ ] Create deployment package
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Validate the output JSON against the schema**
2. Complete integration and end-to-end tests
3. Document usage and deployment

## Success Criteria
- All component types are correctly mapped
- Excel data is accurately converted to JSON
- Generated JSON validates against schema
- Performance meets requirements
- Documentation is complete and clear

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Data Analysis): Completed
- Phase 2 (Development Setup): Completed
- Phase 3 (Core Implementation): Completed
- Phase 4 (Component Implementation): Completed
- Phase 5 (Testing): In Progress
- Phase 6 (Documentation): Pending
- Phase 7 (Deployment): Pending

## Notes
- Regular validation with stakeholders is required
- Keep track of any assumptions or decisions made
- Document any issues or challenges encountered
- Maintain version control of all changes
