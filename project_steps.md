# Project Steps Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the steps for implementing the Excel to JSON conversion POC (Proof of Concept).

## Current Status
- âœ… Analyzed client's Excel data structure
- âœ… Documented JSON schema requirements
- âœ… Created component type mapping documentation
- ðŸ”„ Next steps pending

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Analysis and Mapping (Current Phase)
- [x] Analyze Excel data structure
- [x] Document JSON schema requirements
- [x] Create component type mapping
- [ ] Validate mapping against sample data
- [ ] Create test cases for each component type

### 2. Development Setup
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create project structure
- [ ] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Set up version control
- [ ] Create development branch

### 3. Core Implementation
- [ ] Create Excel parser
  - [ ] Implement Excel file reading
  - [ ] Handle different Excel formats
  - [ ] Extract component data
- [ ] Create JSON generator
  - [ ] Implement component mapping logic
  - [ ] Generate UUIDs
  - [ ] Apply validation rules
  - [ ] Handle special cases

### 4. Component Implementation
- [ ] Implement Selection Components
  - [ ] select_single_cards
  - [ ] select_card
  - [ ] select_single_dropdown
  - [ ] select_option
- [ ] Implement Text Input Components
  - [ ] input_text_line
  - [ ] input_text_area
  - [ ] input_email
- [ ] Implement Numeric Input Components
  - [ ] input_number
  - [ ] input_currency
  - [ ] input_percentage
- [ ] Implement Date and Time Components
  - [ ] pick_date_time
- [ ] Implement File Components
  - [ ] pick_file
- [ ] Implement Overlay Components
  - [ ] input_overlay

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Create test suite
  - [ ] Unit tests for each component
  - [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Validate output against schema
- [ ] Performance testing

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Deployment instructions

### 7. Deployment
- [ ] Create deployment package
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Validate the component mapping against sample data
2. Create test cases for each component type
3. Set up the development environment
4. Begin implementation of the Excel parser

## Success Criteria
- All component types are correctly mapped
- Excel data is accurately converted to JSON
- Generated JSON validates against schema
- Performance meets requirements
- Documentation is complete and clear

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Data Analysis): Completed
- Phase 2 (Development Setup): Pending
- Phase 3 (Core Implementation): Pending
- Phase 4 (Component Implementation): Pending
- Phase 5 (Testing): Pending
- Phase 6 (Documentation): Pending
- Phase 7 (Deployment): Pending

## Notes
- Regular validation with stakeholders is required
- Keep track of any assumptions or decisions made
- Document any issues or challenges encountered
- Maintain version control of all changes
